## üíº SmartHire AI ‚Äì Resume Analyzer Using BERT & LLM

# üß† Introduction

SmartHire AI is an intelligent resume analysis tool designed to help job applicants understand how well their resumes align with a given job description. By leveraging cutting-edge BERT-based embeddings and LLM-powered evaluation (via Groq's LLaMA-3 model), the system delivers deep insights, match scores, and actionable suggestions to improve the chances of landing a dream job.

# What It Does

- Accepts a PDF resume and a job description input.

- Uses Sentence-BERT to compute a similarity score between the resume and job description.

- Interacts with Groq‚Äôs LLaMA-3.3-70b model to perform a detailed resume evaluation.

- Displays both a Resume Match Score and an AI Rating based on qualitative analysis.

- Generates a detailed feedback report on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions.

- Allows users to download the analysis report for offline reference.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Frontend Interface: Built with Streamlit for a seamless and responsive web experience.

- Resume Extraction: Uses pdfminer to extract text content from uploaded PDF resumes.

- Semantic Matching:

  - Utilizes SentenceTransformer with all-mpnet-base-v2 to encode resume and job description into embeddings.

  - Computes cosine similarity for an initial ATS-style match score.

- AI-Powered Evaluation:

   - Sends the resume and job description to the Groq API with a tailored prompt.

   - The LLM evaluates and scores each section of the resume.

- Scoring Logic:

    - Extracts individual scores from the AI's feedback.

     - Calculates an average rating based on the total score out of 5 for each point.
